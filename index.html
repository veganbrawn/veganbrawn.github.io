        <p id="summary">Fruitarian Vegan. Peace Warrior. Social Activist.</p>
        <p>I am committed to doing as much good as I can, whenever I can, however I can.
        </p>

        <p>I belive that we can end a lot of suffering on the planet by coming to a holistic vegan lifestyle. By eating a fruit based diet we can keep our youth, have extraordinary health, and save our ecosystems. After 33k hours of research I have found that the human system is designed to operate most efficiently on ripe fruits. One bite of a juicy peach and it will become part of your biochemistry.

        </p>
        <p>There are many solutions to our most pressing problems. Plant based fruit focused eating strategy for health, environment, animals. Solutions to neutralize government violence such as Agorist technologies like Bitcoin, Airbnb, Lyft, and the ones we create to promote a freer society. We need people in policy and PTA's.
        </p>

        <p>I am committed to health and giving others the advantage of weight loss and easy digestion. I am here on this planet to create peace and Ive got an army of angels on my side. <!--I surrender myself to god.-->
        </P>

        <p>I am continually develping in film, code, music, athletics, spirituality
        </p>

        <p>I am obsessed with health, fruit, peace. Low fat plant based fruit focused lifestyle. Ratios are 80% Carbohydrate, 10% fat, 10% protein. I promote truth in economics and health. Antiwar.
        </p>

        <p>My life is committed to the greater good someting bigger than myself. Suddenly Neurosis and phycosis are gone. On my gravestone, "all used up"
        </P>




        <p>
          I'm determined to make the world a freer place by neutralizing government violence inflicted on people through promoting Antiwar, Bitcion and other agorist related technologies and general Agorism.
